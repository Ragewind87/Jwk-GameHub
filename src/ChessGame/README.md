This repo contains a client-side Chess game built using React.js leveraging Node.js.

This game was developed as part of the "Team Software Project" course in the Fall of 2019 at Michigan Technological University.
It was built by four students, known as team "Pawn Stars". We're very proud of what we were able to create in a single semester.

The project is being hosted here:

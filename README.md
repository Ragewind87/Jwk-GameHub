# Jwk Game Hub

This project contains a client-side board game hub.
It is very much a work in progress. 

The long-term goal of the project is to be capable of hosting two (possibly more) players at once to asynchronously play turn-based board games with one another online.
I will likely be hosting it on Azure.

The project currently includes the following games:

---

### TSP React Chess

This is a Chess game built using `React.js` leveraging `Node.js`.

This game was developed as part of my "Team Software Project" course in the Fall of 2019 at Michigan Technological University.
I led a team of three other students, known as team "Pawn Stars" to build the game from scratch. 
We're very proud of what we were able to create in a single semester with virutally no prior experience using React.

The game was an absolute hit on presentation day. Our professor was impressed that we remembered to implement the "En passant" move.
